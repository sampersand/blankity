module Blankity
  # An "emptier" class than {BasicObject}, which +undef+ines nearly all instance methods.
  #
  # Not _all_ methods are undefined (see {AboslutelyBlank} for a class which does):
  #
  # - Methods which match +/\\A__.*__\\z/+ are not removed. Traditionally, these methods are expected
  #   to always be present (and +undef+ing them warns you!). Ruby has two of these: +__send__+
  #   and +__id__+
  # - Private methods are not undefined, as each one of them is expected to be present (most of them
  #   are hooks, eg +singleton_method_added+), and aren't easily accessible from external classes.
  #
  # To make using +Blank+ easier, it also provides the {Blank#__with_Object_methods__} method
  # to define singleton methods on instances that {Object} defines.
  class Blank < BasicObject
    # Declare these as constants so we don't constantly look them up.

    # Creates a new {BlankValue}, and defining singleton methods depending on the parameters
    #
    # @param methods [Array[interned]] a list of {Object} methods to define on +self+.
    # @param hash [bool] convenience argument, adds +hash+ and +eql?+ to +methods+ so the resulting
    #                    type can be used as a key in +Hash+es
    # @yield [] if a block is given, runs it via +instance_exec+.

    #
    # @param methods [*interned] The list of instance methods from {Object} to define

    # === Example
    #   # Make an empty instance
    #   blank = Blankity::Blank.blank
    #
    #   # Make sure it's printable
    #   blank.__with_Object_methods__(:inspect, :==)
    #
    #   # Now you can use them!
    #   fail unless blank == blank
    #   p blank
